# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Being respectful and inclusive** - Using welcoming and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully accepting constructive criticism, and focusing on what is best for the community
* **Showing empathy** - Being considerate of others' feelings and experiences, especially when they differ from your own
* **Collaborating effectively** - Working together toward common goals, sharing knowledge and expertise, and helping others learn and grow
* **Being constructive** - Providing helpful feedback, suggestions, and contributions that improve the project
* **Respecting boundaries** - Acknowledging when someone says "no" or "stop" and respecting their decision
* **Focusing on what is best** - Prioritizing the community's collective interests over individual preferences

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project e-mail address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing code, documentation, or other project resources
* Participating in discussions, issues, pull requests, or other project activities

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project maintainers:

* **GitHub**: Open a private security advisory or contact maintainers directly through GitHub
* **Issues**: For non-sensitive matters, you may open a private issue (mark as sensitive if needed)
* **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions with appropriate privacy settings for general community concerns

All reports will be handled with confidentiality and discretion.

When reporting, please include:
* Your contact information (if you're comfortable sharing)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Description of the behavior and the context in which it occurred
* Any additional context that may be helpful

We will investigate every report and respond as quickly as possible. We are committed to maintaining confidentiality and protecting the privacy of those who report violations.
