## System requirements

| Requirement      | Minimum                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Bun or Node.js   | Bun 1.0+ or Node.js 18+ (only if route scripts import npm packages) |

The Hyperterse binary is a single statically linked executable. It has no runtime dependencies — no external runtime is needed to build or serve manifests.

## Install

Hyperterse is available on multiple package managers. The recommended way to install is via the installer script, but you can also install manually.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```bash cURL
  curl -fsSL https://hyperterse.com/install | bash
  ```

```bash npm
npm install -g hyperterse
```

```bash bun
bun install -g Hyperterse
```

```bash brew
brew install hyperterse/tap/hyperterse
```

</CodeGroup>

Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:

```bash
hyperterse --version
```

## Upgrade

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
hyperterse upgrade
```

Include pre-release builds with `--prerelease`, or target a specific major version with `--major 3` or `--major next`.
