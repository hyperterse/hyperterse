| Bun or Node.js | Bun 1.0+ or Node.js 18+ (only required if route scripts import npm packages) |

The Hyperterse binary is a statically linked Go executable with no runtime dependencies. TypeScript bundling uses the embedded esbuild compiler — no external JavaScript runtime is needed to serve built manifests.
