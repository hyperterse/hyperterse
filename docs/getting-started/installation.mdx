title: Installation
description: Install the Hyperterse CLI binary or build it from source. Includes system requirements, verification, and upgrade procedures.
---

## System Requirements

| Requirement | Minimum |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Linux (amd64, arm64), macOS (amd64, arm64), Windows (amd64) |
| Go (build from source only) | 1.22+ |
| Bun or Node.js (route scripts only) | Bun 1.0+ or Node.js 18+ for `npm install` of route dependencies |

The compiled Hyperterse binary is a statically linked Go executable with no runtime dependencies. Route script bundling (TypeScript) is performed at build time using the embedded esbuild compiler — no external JavaScript runtime is required to serve built manifests.

---

## Install via Script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hyperterse.com/install | bash
```

The install script detects your platform and architecture, downloads the appropriate binary, and places it in a directory on your `$PATH`.

Verify the installation:

```bash
hyperterse --version
```

Expected output:

```
hyperterse version X.Y.Z
```

---

## Build from Source

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperterse/hyperterse.git
cd hyperterse
go mod download
make generate
make build
```

The build produces a binary in `dist/`. Add it to your `$PATH` or invoke it directly:

```bash
./dist/hyperterse --version
```

### Build Prerequisites

- Go 1.22 or later
- `protoc` (Protocol Buffers compiler) for `make generate`
- `protoc-gen-go` plugin for Go protobuf code generation

---

## Verify the CLI

After installation, confirm all commands are available:

```bash
hyperterse --help
```

The following commands should be listed:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start` | Start runtime from configuration source |
| `serve` | Serve a pre-built manifest |
| `build` | Compile project into deployable output |
| `validate` | Validate configuration and route scripts |
| `init` | Scaffold a new project |
| `upgrade` | Upgrade the installed binary |

---

## Upgrade

Upgrade to the latest stable release:

```bash
hyperterse upgrade
```

### Upgrade Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--prerelease` | Include pre-release versions in upgrade candidates |
| `--major <n\|next>` | Target a specific major version or the next major version |

After upgrading, verify with `hyperterse --version`.
