description: Connect a Vercel-hosted frontend to a Hyperterse MCP server.
---

Vercel excels at hosting frontends and serverless functions. For Hyperterse — a long-running server process — the recommended architecture is to deploy Hyperterse on a container platform and connect your Vercel frontend to it through API routes.

<Note>
  Hyperterse requires a persistent server process. Deploy it on [Railway](/deployment/railway), [AWS](/deployment/aws), [GCP](/deployment/gcp), [Azure](/deployment/azure), [DigitalOcean](/deployment/digital-ocean), or [bare metal](/deployment/bare-metal), then configure your Vercel project to communicate with it.
</Note>

## Architecture

Your Vercel frontend communicates with Hyperterse through server-side API routes. This keeps your Hyperterse endpoint private and lets Vercel handle CORS, authentication, and caching at the edge.

```
Browser → Vercel Edge → API Route → Hyperterse Server → Database
```

## Configure the proxy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the Hyperterse URL as an environment variable">
    In the Vercel dashboard, go to **Settings > Environment Variables** and add:

    ```
    HYPERTERSE_URL=https://your-hyperterse-deployment.example.com
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API route">
    Forward MCP requests from your frontend to the Hyperterse server:

    ```typescript
    // app/api/mcp/route.ts (Next.js App Router)
    import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

    export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
      const body = await request.json();

      const response = await fetch(`${process.env.HYPERTERSE_URL}/mcp`, {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
      });

      const data = await response.json();
      return NextResponse.json(data, { status: response.status });
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Push to your connected Git repository, or deploy manually:

    ```bash
    vercel --prod
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rewrites

As an alternative to an API route, use Vercel rewrites to proxy requests directly:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/mcp",
      "destination": "https://your-hyperterse-deployment.example.com/mcp"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add this to your `vercel.json`. Vercel forwards matching requests to your Hyperterse server without exposing its URL to the client.

## Considerations

- **Latency**: Place your Hyperterse server in the same region as your primary user base to minimize round-trip time.
- **Authentication**: Add authentication in your API route or Vercel middleware before forwarding requests to Hyperterse.
- **Timeouts**: Vercel serverless functions have execution time limits. For long-running tool calls, ensure your Hyperterse queries complete within the Vercel timeout window, or use streaming responses.
