description: Deploy Hyperterse on Railway with zero infrastructure management.

Railway is the fastest path from build artifact to running server. It detects your Dockerfile, provisions infrastructure, and gives you a public URL — all in a single deploy command.

## Deploy to Railway

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build the artifact">
    ```bash
    hyperterse build -o dist
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Dockerfile">
    Use the [Docker deployment patterns](/deployment/docker) to create your Dockerfile, or use a minimal example:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:20-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY dist/ ./dist/
    COPY node_modules/ ./node_modules/
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD ["npx", "hyperterse", "serve"]
    ```

    <Note>
      Adjust the Dockerfile to match your project structure. The key requirement is that the `dist/` directory containing the build artifact is available at runtime.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Railway CLI">
    ```bash
    npm install -g @railway/cli
    railway login
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize and deploy">
    ```bash
    railway init
    railway up
    ```

    Railway detects the Dockerfile, builds the image, and deploys it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set environment variables">
    ```bash
    railway variables set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db"
    ```

    Or configure variables in the Railway dashboard under your service's settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expose the service">
    In the Railway dashboard, go to your service's **Settings** and generate a public domain. Your Hyperterse MCP endpoint will be available at `https://<your-domain>/mcp`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Railway-managed databases

Railway provides one-click managed databases. Add a PostgreSQL or MySQL plugin from the dashboard, and Railway automatically injects the connection string as an environment variable.

```bash
railway add --plugin postgresql
```

Reference the injected variable in your `.terse` configuration:

```yaml
adapters:
  main:
    connector: postgresql
    connection_string: "{{ env.DATABASE_URL }}"
```

## Custom domains

In the Railway dashboard, navigate to **Settings > Domains** and add your custom domain. Railway provisions TLS certificates automatically.

## Scaling

Railway supports horizontal scaling through the dashboard. Increase the number of replicas under your service's **Settings > Scaling** section. Each replica runs an independent instance of `hyperterse serve`.
