description: Build MCP tool servers from declarative configuration with built-in authentication, caching, and observability.
---

Every AI agent that queries a database, calls an API, or runs business logic needs the same infrastructure: connection management, input validation, authentication, caching, observability, and a transport protocol that LLMs understand.

With Hyperterse, you define your tools in YAML configuration files. The framework compiles, validates, bundles, and serves them as a standards-compliant [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. You own the data and the logic — the framework handles everything else.

## What you can build

You use Hyperterse to expose databases and custom logic as MCP tools that any AI agent can call. A typical tool definition looks like this:

```yaml app/tools/get-user/config.terse
description: 'Get user by ID'
use: primary-db
statement: 'SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE id = {{ inputs.user_id }}'
inputs:
  user_id:
    type: int
    required: true
auth:
  plugin: api_key
  policy:
    value: '{{ env.API_KEY }}'
```

This configuration creates an MCP tool called `get-user` that queries your database, validates inputs, and enforces API key authentication — without writing any application code.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your tools">
    Create `.terse` YAML files for your database connections and tools. Each
    directory under `app/tools/` becomes one MCP tool.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compile your project">
    Run `hyperterse build` to validate configuration, bundle scripts, and
    serialize everything into a single deployable artifact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Serve your MCP server">
    Run `hyperterse serve` to boot from the compiled artifact. Your tools are
    immediately available at `/mcp` over Streamable HTTP.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  During development, run `hyperterse start --watch` to skip the separate build
  step. The framework recompiles automatically on every file change.

  <Card
    title="Database adapters"
    icon="database"
    href="/concepts/adapters"
  >
    Connect to PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or Redis. Define connection strings
    in `app/adapters/` — the framework manages pooling, health checks, and
    shutdown.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Filesystem-based tool discovery"
    icon="folder"
    href="/concepts/tools"
  >
    Each folder under `app/tools/` maps to one MCP tool. No manual registration
    — the directory name becomes the tool name.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Embedded scripting"
    icon="code"
    href="/concepts/scripts"
  >
    Add TypeScript handlers and transforms when you need logic that
    configuration alone cannot express. Scripts run in a sandboxed runtime with
    `fetch` and `console`.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Per-tool authentication"
    icon="lock"
    href="/concepts/authentication"
  >
    Attach authentication to any tool with a built-in `api_key` plugin, or write
    your own. No global middleware to configure.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="In-memory caching"
    icon="bolt"
    href="/runtime/caching"
  >
    Enable query result caching globally or per-tool with a TTL. Identical
    requests return cached results without hitting your database.
  </Card>
  <Card

    Built-in OpenTelemetry support gives you distributed tracing, metrics, and
    structured logging out of the box.
