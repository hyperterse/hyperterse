description: Hyperterse is a Go-native MCP framework that compiles declarative configuration into a production-ready tool runtime with embedded scripting, pluggable authentication, and filesystem-based routing.

## What Hyperterse Is

Hyperterse is a compiled MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework written in Go. It transforms declarative `.terse` configuration files and optional TypeScript scripts into a runtime that exposes database queries and custom logic as callable MCP tools.

The framework handles connector lifecycle management, input validation, script bundling, query caching, authentication enforcement, and observability instrumentation. You define the shape of your tools through configuration; Hyperterse compiles and serves them.

### Design Principles

- **Declarative-first.** Adapters, routes, inputs, auth policies, and caching behavior are expressed in `.terse` YAML files. Code is reserved for logic that configuration cannot express.
- **Tool-first routing.** Each route folder maps to exactly one MCP tool. The filesystem is the tool registry.
- **Compiled runtime.** `hyperterse build` produces a self-contained binary and serialized manifest (`model.bin`). The production runtime boots from the manifest without re-parsing source files.
- **Embedded scripting.** Route handlers and transforms are written in TypeScript, bundled with esbuild at build time, and executed inside a Goja JavaScript VM within the Go process. No external Node.js dependency is required at runtime.
- **Protocol-native.** MCP Streamable HTTP is the primary transport. Tools, inputs, and results map directly to MCP `tools/list` and `tools/call` operations.

### What Hyperterse Is Not

Hyperterse is not a general-purpose HTTP framework, an ORM, a database migration tool, or a GraphQL server. It serves a specific purpose: exposing structured data operations and custom handlers as MCP tools with minimal boilerplate.

## Runtime Surface

The compiled runtime registers two endpoint groups:

| Endpoint | Methods | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/mcp` | `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE` | MCP Streamable HTTP transport. Handles `tools/list`, `tools/call`, and session management. |
| `/heartbeat` | `GET` | Health check. Returns `{"success": true}` when the runtime is accepting connections. |

Direct REST endpoints (`/query/{name}`) are defined in protobuf service contracts but are not registered by the current runtime. All tool invocation routes through the MCP transport.

---

## Supported Connectors

| Connector | Identifier | Driver |
|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL | `postgres` | `lib/pq` |
| MySQL | `mysql` | `go-sql-driver/mysql` |
| MongoDB | `mongodb` | `mongo-driver` (JSON statement payloads) |
| Redis | `redis` | `go-redis` |

Connectors are initialized at startup through a parallel connection manager. Initialization failures block the runtime from starting.

---

## Supported Input Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `string` | UTF-8 text |
| `int` | 64-bit signed integer |
| `float` | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point |
| `boolean` | `true` or `false` |
| `datetime` | ISO 8601 timestamp string |

`uuid` is not a built-in primitive. Generate or validate UUIDs in input transform scripts when required.

## High-Level Lifecycle

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Parse root config (.hyperterse)              │
│  2. Discover app/adapters/*.terse                │
│  3. Discover app/routes/*/config.terse           │
│  4. Compile routes into tool definitions         │
│  5. Bundle TypeScript scripts + vendor deps      │
│  6. Serialize manifest (model.bin)               │
│  7. Start runtime, init connectors               │
│  8. Register MCP tools, begin accepting requests │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In development, `hyperterse start --watch` performs steps 1–5 on each file change and restarts the runtime. In production, `hyperterse build` performs steps 1–6 once, and `hyperterse serve` performs steps 7–8 from the pre-built manifest.
