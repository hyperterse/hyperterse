## Registered endpoints

Current server registers:

- `GET/POST/DELETE /mcp` (MCP Streamable HTTP handler)
- `GET /heartbeat` (health check)

## Heartbeat

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/heartbeat
```

Response:

```json
{ "success": true }
```

## MCP list tools

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/list",
    "id": 1
  }'
```

## MCP call tool

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "get-user",
      "arguments": {
        "user_id": 123
      }
    },
    "id": 2
  }'
```

Tool response content is returned as text payload containing JSON-encoded result rows.

## About `/query/{name}`

Protobuf contracts include query RPC definitions, but the current runtime server does not register direct `/query/{name}` HTTP endpoints.
