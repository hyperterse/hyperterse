title: Execution pipeline
description: Deterministic execution flow for tool invocations from route resolution through response serialization.
---

Every `tools/call` request passes through a deterministic pipeline. The stages are identical for DB-backed and script-backed routes — only the execution step differs. If any stage fails, execution halts immediately and an error response is returned.

## Route resolution

The runtime matches the tool name from the `tools/call` request to a compiled route definition. Lookup is O(1) via an in-memory map populated at startup.

If no route matches, a JSON-RPC error is returned with code `-32601`.

## Authentication

If the route defines an `auth` block, the configured plugin is invoked with the request context and policy parameters.

- Plugin returns `nil`: authentication passes, pipeline continues.
- Plugin returns an error: pipeline halts, error returned to caller.
- No `auth` block: stage is skipped entirely.

## Input transform

If `scripts.input_transform` is configured or discovered by convention, the `inputTransform` function executes in the embedded runtime.

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "inputs": { "user_id": 42 },
  "route": "get-user"
}
```

The returned object replaces the inputs for all subsequent stages. Throwing an error aborts the pipeline.

If no input transform is configured, inputs pass through unchanged.

## Execution

The execution stage branches based on the route's configuration. Only one path runs per invocation.

### Script-backed routes

When `scripts.handler` is configured, the `handler` function executes in the embedded runtime. The return value becomes the execution result.

### DB-backed routes

When `use` and `statement` are configured, the executor runs six substeps:

1. **Input validation.** Validate all declared inputs against type definitions. Missing required inputs and type mismatches produce errors.
2. **Environment substitution.** Resolve `{{ env.VAR }}` placeholders. Missing variables produce errors.
3. **Input substitution.** Replace `{{ inputs.field }}` placeholders with post-transform values. Substitution is textual.
4. **Cache check.** If caching is enabled, compute the cache key from query name + statement hash. On hit, return cached result and skip connector execution.
5. **Connector execution.** Delegate the statement to the connector's `Execute` method. Returns `[]map[string]any`.
6. **Cache store.** On miss, store the result with the configured TTL.

## Output transform

If `scripts.output_transform` is configured or discovered by convention, the `outputTransform` function executes in the embedded runtime.

**Payload:**

```json
{
  "results": [{ "id": 42, "name": "Jane Doe", "email": "jane@example.com" }],
  "route": "get-user"
}
```

The returned value replaces the result for response serialization. Throwing an error aborts the pipeline.

If no output transform is configured, the raw result is used directly.

## Response serialization

The final result is JSON-encoded and wrapped in an MCP content block:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "[{\"id\":42,\"name\":\"Jane Doe\",\"email\":\"jane@example.com\"}]"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error propagation

| Stage               | Error condition                | JSON-RPC code |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Route resolution    | Tool name not found            | `-32601`      |
| Authentication      | Plugin returns error           | `-32000`      |
| Input transform     | Script throws                  | `-32000`      |
| Input validation    | Missing input or type mismatch | `-32000`      |
| Env substitution    | Missing variable               | `-32000`      |
| Connector execution | Query error                    | `-32000`      |
| Handler execution   | Script throws                  | `-32000`      |
| Output transform    | Script throws                  | `-32000`      |

Error messages from scripts and connectors are included in the response. Stack traces are logged at debug level but not exposed to callers.

## Observability hooks

Each pipeline execution is instrumented with OpenTelemetry spans when tracing is enabled. Span attributes include tool name, execution stage, cache hit/miss, connector type, and duration. Sensitive values are redacted. See [Observability](/runtime/observability).
