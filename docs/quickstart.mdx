description: Scaffold a Hyperterse project, define a tool, and invoke it through MCP in under five minutes.
---

This guide takes you from an empty directory to a running MCP tool server. By the end, you will have a database-backed hello-world tool responding to `tools/call` requests.

## Scaffold a project

```bash
hyperterse init
```

This generates the starter structure:

<Tree>
  <Tree.File name=".hyperterse" />
  <Tree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <Tree.Folder name="adapters" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.File name="my-database.terse" />
    </Tree.Folder>
    <Tree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.Folder name="hello-world" defaultOpen>
        <Tree.File name="config.terse" />
        <Tree.File name="user-data-mapper.ts" />
      </Tree.Folder>
    </Tree.Folder>
  </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

`.hyperterse` is the root service configuration. `app/adapters/` holds database connection definitions. `app/tools/hello-world/` contains a DB-backed tool and its TypeScript output mapper.

## Review the root configuration

Open `.hyperterse`:

```yaml
name: myconfig
server:
  port: 8080
  log_level: 3
```

`name` identifies the service. `server.port` sets the TCP port. `server.log_level` controls verbosity: 1 = error, 2 = warn, 3 = info, 4 = debug.

This is the entire root config. Adapters and tools live in the `app/` directory — the root config handles service-level settings only.

## Start the server

```bash
hyperterse start
```

The CLI loads `.hyperterse` from the current directory, discovers adapters and tools under `app/`, compiles tool definitions, bundles any TypeScript scripts, and starts the MCP server.

For automatic restarts on file changes during development:

```bash
hyperterse start --watch
```

## Verify the server is running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/heartbeat
```

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The `/heartbeat` endpoint confirms the HTTP server is accepting connections. It does not check connector health.

## List registered tools

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/list",
    "id": 1
  }' | jq
```

The response contains a `tools` array with one entry per compiled tool. Each tool includes its name, description, and a JSON Schema describing its input parameters.

## Inspect the scaffolded tool

Open `app/tools/hello-world/config.terse`:

```yaml
description: "Hello world tool"
use: my-database
statement: |
  SELECT first_name FROM users WHERE id = {{ inputs.userId }}
inputs:
  userId:
    type: int
    description: "User ID provided by the agent."
mappers:
  output: "user-data-mapper.ts"
auth:
  plugin: allow_all
```

This tool uses the `my-database` adapter, queries a user's first name from Postgres, and formats the response through `user-data-mapper.ts`.

## Configure the adapter and test hello-world

The scaffolded project includes a placeholder adapter. Point it to a real database with a `users` table.

### Configure the adapter

Edit `app/adapters/my-database.terse`:

```yaml
connector: postgres
connection_string: '{{ env.DATABASE_URL }}'
```

Set the environment variable:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

### Test the tool

Restart the server (or let `--watch` pick up the change), then call the scaffolded tool:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "hello-world",
      "arguments": { "userId": 1 }
    },
    "id": 3
  }' | jq
```

## Validate before deploying

```bash
hyperterse validate
```

Validation catches errors before they reach production: missing adapter fields, invalid input types, unresolvable script paths, and bundle compilation failures. A zero exit code means the project is structurally sound.
