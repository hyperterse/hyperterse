description: Scaffold a Hyperterse project, define a tool, and invoke it through MCP in under five minutes.
---

This guide takes you from an empty directory to a running MCP tool server. By the end, you will have a health check tool and a database-backed query tool responding to `tools/call` requests.

## Scaffold a project

```bash
hyperterse init
```

This generates the starter structure:

```
.hyperterse
app/
  adapters/
    my-database.terse
  tools/
    health/
      config.terse
      handler.ts
```

`.hyperterse` is the root service configuration. `app/adapters/` holds database connection definitions. `app/tools/health/` is a script-backed tool with a TypeScript handler.

## Review the root configuration

Open `.hyperterse`:

```yaml
name: myconfig
server:
  port: 8080
  log_level: 3
```

`name` identifies the service. `server.port` sets the TCP port. `server.log_level` controls verbosity: 1 = error, 2 = warn, 3 = info, 4 = debug.

This is the entire root config. Adapters and tools live in the `app/` directory — the root config handles service-level settings only.

## Start the server

```bash
hyperterse start
```

The CLI loads `.hyperterse` from the current directory, discovers adapters and tools under `app/`, compiles tool definitions, bundles any TypeScript scripts, and starts the MCP server.

For automatic restarts on file changes during development:

```bash
hyperterse start --watch
```

## Verify the server is running

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/heartbeat
```

```json
{ "success": true }
```

The `/heartbeat` endpoint confirms the HTTP server is accepting connections. It does not check connector health.

## List registered tools

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/list",
    "id": 1
  }' | jq
```

The response contains a `tools` array with one entry per compiled tool. Each tool includes its name, description, and a JSON Schema describing its input parameters.

## Call a tool

Invoke the `health` tool:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "health",
      "arguments": {}
    },
    "id": 2
  }' | jq
```

The tool's output appears in the `content` field as a JSON-encoded text payload.

## Add a database-backed tool

The scaffolded project includes a placeholder adapter. Connect it to a real database and create a query tool.

### Configure the adapter

Edit `app/adapters/my-database.terse`:

```yaml
connector: postgres
connection_string: '{{ env.DATABASE_URL }}'
```

Set the environment variable:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb"
```

### Create a tool

Create `app/tools/list-users/config.terse`:

```yaml
description: 'List all users with optional limit'
use: my-database
statement: |
  SELECT id, name, email
  FROM users
  LIMIT {{ inputs.limit }}
inputs:
  limit:
    type: int
    description: 'Maximum number of rows to return'
    default: '10'
auth:
  plugin: allow_all
```

This defines an MCP tool called `list-users`. It executes a SQL statement through the `my-database` adapter, accepts a `limit` input with a default of 10, and uses the `allow_all` auth plugin (no authentication enforced).

### Test the tool

Restart the server (or let `--watch` pick up the change), then call the tool:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list-users",
      "arguments": { "limit": 5 }
    },
    "id": 3
  }' | jq
```

## Validate before deploying

```bash
hyperterse validate
```

Validation catches errors before they reach production: missing adapter fields, invalid input types, unresolvable script paths, and bundle compilation failures. A zero exit code means the project is structurally sound.
