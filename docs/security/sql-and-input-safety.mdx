title: SQL and Input Safety
description: Security model and current substitution caveats.

## What Hyperterse protects by default

- Connection strings stay server-side.
- Tool callers do not see adapter credentials.
- Inputs are validated against declared tool/query input types.
- Tool-level auth plugins can enforce access policies.

## Critical caveat: statement substitution

Current executor substitution is raw string replacement for `{{ inputs.x }}` placeholders.

That means:

- values are inserted into statement text,
- connector execution uses the final statement directly,
- statement safety depends on your query patterns and transform logic.

## Recommended safety practices

- Prefer strict input typing and custom input transforms.
- Avoid building unconstrained dynamic SQL fragments.
- Keep statement templates narrow and deterministic.
- Use tool handlers for complex logic where you need stronger control.
- Put runtime behind gateway/auth/rate-limit layers in production.

## Environment variable substitution

`{{ env.VAR_NAME }}` is resolved at runtime for connection strings/statements. Missing env vars fail startup or execution early instead of silently defaulting.
