title: Adapters
description: Named database connections that tools reference for query execution.

An adapter is a named binding between the Hyperterse runtime and a database. You define the connector type and connection string in a `.terse` file under `app/adapters/`, and tools reference adapters by name through the `use` field. The framework handles connection pooling, health checks, and graceful shutdown.

## Defining an adapter

Each adapter file declares a connector type and a connection string:

```yaml
name: primary-db
connector: postgres
connection_string: '{{ env.DATABASE_URL }}'
options:
  sslmode: require
```

The `connector` field selects the database engine. The `connection_string` accepts `{{ env.VAR }}` placeholders, which are resolved at runtime from environment variables. Never commit plaintext credentials — always use environment variables or a secrets manager.

## Supported connectors

Hyperterse ships with four built-in connectors:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="PostgreSQL"
    icon="database"
    href="/databases/postgresql"
  >
    SQL queries via `postgresql://` connection strings.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="MySQL"
    icon="database"
    href="/databases/mysql"
  >
    SQL queries via DSN-format connection strings.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="MongoDB"
    icon="leaf"
    href="/databases/mongodb"
  >
    JSON command payloads via `mongodb://` connection strings.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Redis"
    icon="bolt"
    href="/databases/redis"
  >
    Key-value operations via `redis://` connection strings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Referencing adapters from tools

Tools point to an adapter by name:

```yaml
# app/tools/get-user/config.terse
use: primary-db
statement: 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{ inputs.user_id }}'
```

A project can define multiple adapters, and different tools can reference different ones:

<Tree>
  <Tree.Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <Tree.Folder name="adapters" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.File name="users-db.terse" comment="PostgreSQL for user data" />
      <Tree.File name="analytics-db.terse" comment="MySQL for analytics" />
      <Tree.File name="cache.terse" comment="Redis for caching" />
    </Tree.Folder>
  </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

## Lifecycle

All adapters referenced by at least one tool are initialized in parallel at startup. Each connector establishes its pool and runs a connectivity check. If any connector fails — unreachable host, invalid credentials, network timeout — the runtime exits immediately. This fail-fast behavior prevents serving tools that would error on every request.

On shutdown (`SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`), all connectors close concurrently after in-flight queries complete.
