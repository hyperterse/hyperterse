Hyperterse is a high-performance runtime server that transforms database queries into **REST endpoints** and **MCP tools**. Define queries in a configuration file and Hyperterse handles execution, validation, documentation, and AI integration.

## Why Hyperterse?

Hyperterse is designed for AI-first applications. It serves multiple use cases, and is aimed to simplify the integration of your database with AI agents, LLMs or other systems.

## How it works

Define your queries once in a simple configuration file:

```yaml title="config.terse"
name: my-api

adapters:
  production_db:
    connector: postgres
    connection_string: 'postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db'

queries:
  get-user:
    use: production_db
    description: 'Retrieve a user by email address'
    statement: |
      SELECT id, name, email, created_at
      FROM users
      WHERE email = {{ inputs.email }}
    inputs:
      email:
        type: string
        description: 'User email address'
```

Run the server:

```bash
hyperterse run -f config.terse
```

Call your query via REST or MCP:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/query/get-user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com"}'
```

## What's included

- **REST Endpoints**: Each query becomes its own REST endpoint
- **MCP Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0 tools
- **OpenAPI Docs**: Auto-generated
- **LLM Documentation**: AI-friendly
- **Input Validation**: Strong typing and validation by default
- **Security**: Connection strings and raw SQL never exposed to clients
- **Hot reloading**: Development mode with automatic reload on configuration changes
