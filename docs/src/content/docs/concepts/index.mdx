Hyperterse is built around three simple concepts: **Adapters**, **Queries**, and **Inputs**. Understanding these will help you build powerful data APIs quickly.

## Key concepts

<LinkCard
  title="Adapters"
  href="/concepts/adapters"
  description="Database connections. Define how Hyperterse connects to PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Redis."
/>
<LinkCard
  title="Queries"
  href="/concepts/queries"
  description="SQL statements that become API endpoints. Define what data to expose."
/>
<LinkCard
  title="Inputs"
  href="/concepts/inputs"
  description="Typed parameters for your queries. Define what data clients can pass in."
/>

## How they work together

1. **Adapters** establish database connections
2. **Queries** define SQL statements that use those adapters
3. **Inputs** parameterize queries with validated, typed data
4. Hyperterse generates REST endpoints, MCP tools, and documentation automatically

### Example

```yaml
# 1. adapter: connect to the database
adapters:
  main_db:
    connector: postgres
    connection_string: 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/app'

# 2. query: define what to expose
queries:
  get-user:
    use: main_db # Which adapter to use
    description: 'Get user by ID'
    statement: |
      SELECT id, name, email
      FROM users
      WHERE id = {{ inputs.userId }}  # 3. Input: Parameterize
    inputs:
      userId:
        type: int
        description: 'User ID'
```

This single configuration generates:

- `POST /query/get-user` — REST endpoint
- MCP tool `get-user` — For AI assistants
- OpenAPI documentation at `/docs`
- LLM-friendly documentation at `/llms.txt`

## What Hyperterse is not

Understanding what Hyperterse doesn't do helps set expectations:

| Hyperterse Is        | Hyperterse Is Not         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| A query gateway      | An ORM                    |
| Configuration-driven | A code generator          |
| Stateless runtime    | A database migration tool |
| Read-optimized       | A full CRUD framework     |

You write SQL directly—Hyperterse doesn't abstract it away. This gives you full control over query performance and behavior.
