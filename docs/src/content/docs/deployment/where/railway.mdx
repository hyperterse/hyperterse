Railway is one of the easiest ways to deploy Hyperterse.

<Aside>
  **First**: Run `hyperterse export -f config.terse -o dist` to create a
  deployment bundle.
</Aside>

## Quick deploy

### Step 1: Create dockerfile

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM alpine:3.19
RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates
WORKDIR /app
COPY dist/hyperterse /app/hyperterse
COPY dist/config.terse /app/config.terse
RUN chmod +x /app/hyperterse
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/app/hyperterse", "run", "-f", "/app/config.terse"]
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Hyperterse deployment"
git push
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Railway

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Select your repository
4. Railway auto-detects Dockerfile and deploys

### Step 3: Add environment variables

In Railway dashboard:

- Add `DATABASE_URL` with your database connection string
- Or connect a Railway PostgreSQL database

## Railway PostgreSQL

Add a PostgreSQL database directly in Railway:

1. Click "New" → "Database" → "Add PostgreSQL"
2. Railway provides `DATABASE_URL` automatically
3. Link to your Hyperterse service

## Configuration

Railway automatically:

- Assigns a public URL
- Provides SSL
- Handles restarts
- Streams logs

## Environment variables

```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway variables set DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Or in dashboard
# Settings → variables
```

## Custom domain

1. Add domain in Railway dashboard
2. Configure DNS CNAME to Railway's domain
3. SSL is automatic

## Scaling

Railway supports horizontal scaling:

- Adjust replica count in dashboard
- Configure health checks

## Logs

```bash
railway logs
```

Or view in Railway dashboard.
