description: Query result caching behavior and configuration.

Hyperterse includes executor-level in-memory caching (Ristretto).

## How cache keys are built

Cache key is derived from:

- query name
- final substituted statement hash

So the same query with different substituted statements creates separate cache entries.

## Global cache config

```yaml
tools:
  cache:
    enabled: true
    ttl: 60
```

## Per-tool override

```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true
  ttl: 30
```

Or disable for one tool/query:

```yaml
cache:
  enabled: false
```

## Policy precedence

1. Tool-level cache config
2. Root `tools.cache` config
3. Defaults

Default TTL is `120` seconds when enabled and no TTL override is supplied.

## Current characteristics

- In-process cache (not distributed)
- Memory bounded by Ristretto settings
- Results are cloned before store/return to avoid mutation side effects
